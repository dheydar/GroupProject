**Introduction of research question**

We propose to study crime rates in Los Angeles County and compare the rate to various factors including current COVID-19 cases, affordable housing, and other socioeconomic factors. Due to the global pandemic, crime rates have fluctuated substantially due to the lockdown and the reopening of the county. Additionally, the pandemic has caused an influx of unemployment, thus affecting the affordability of living and homelessness.

**Why is it important to us, why it matters to others, and what is at stake?**

This research is important because the pandemic is still amongst us and can lead to more cases of homelessness and crime. Before the pandemic, Los Angeles was already facing a homelessness crisis, however now, housing instability may be worsening due to COVID-19 outcomes. The increase of unemployment can result in the rise of homelessness and increase of crime rates in Los Angeles County. Additionally, we would like to analyze the disparate impact on minorities that this could have.

**Description of spatial scope and why space and/or time matters for our project**

We plan on looking at the Los Angeles, California area. The specific area studied for our project matters because different areas have been impacted differently by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Time is also a relevant factor to our study in that we can look at how crime rates or housing outcomes have differed before the onset of COVID to now.
