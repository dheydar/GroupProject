**Introduction of research question**

We propose to study crime rates in Los Angeles County and compare the rate to various factors including current COVID-19 cases, education attainment, income and other socioeconomic factors. Due to the global pandemic, crime rates have fluctuated substantially due to the lockdown and the reopening of the county. Additionally, the pandemic has caused an influx of unemployment, thus affecting the affordability of living and homelessness.

**Why is it important to us, why it matters to others, and what is at stake?**

This research is important because the pandemic is still amongst us and can lead to more cases of homelessness and crime. Before the pandemic, Los Angeles was already facing a homelessness crisis, however now, housing instability may be worsening due to COVID-19 outcomes. The increase of unemployment can result in the rise of homelessness and increase of crime rates in Los Angeles County. Additionally, we would like to analyze the disparate impact on minorities that this could have.

**Description of spatial scope and why space and/or time matters for our project**

We plan on looking at the Los Angeles, California area. The specific area studied for our project matters because different areas have been impacted differently by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Time is also a relevant factor to our study in that we can look at how crime rates or housing outcomes have differed before the onset of COVID to now.   

**Preliminary but Definitive Description of Data Sources that we will use**

* Current Crime Rates in LA County
  * https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

This dataset includes cases of crime within Los Angeles for the year 2020. This data is based on the original crime reports provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. 

* Education Attainment for LA County (2014-2018),
  * Social Explorer

* Household Income for LA County (2018),
  * Social Explorer

* White vs. Non-White Homeowners (2018), 
  * Social Explorer

* COVID-19 Data from 2020 to Present, 
  * https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data

* Mapping Inequality/ Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) LA Redlining Map (1939), 
  * http://clsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58

  
**Scope that explains intended analysis and resulting visualizations for our project**

Our intended analysis for this project is to analyze if there is any overlap between where COVID cases and crime are occuring in Los Angeles. For part of our analysis, we also seek to understand if COVID and crime intersect with average household income. Some of the possible visualizations that we may produce as a part of our project include charts and maps relating to where COVID cases are concentrated in Los Angeles, where crime is concentrated in Los Angeles, as well as where lower median income or lower educational attainment  is located in Los Angeles. A significant component to these maps and charts is that we intend to incorporate demographic data to understand how outcomes have differed by income or education.  

**Concluding paragraph of what insights we expect to gain from our research**

Ultimately, we expect to gain a better understanding of how COVID, crime, and housing outcomes in the Los Angeles area are interrelated. Considering that Los Angeles continues to be one of the areas impacted most by COVID within California, it will be interesting to see how the pandemic and related variables have influenced crime within LA. While some cities have seen crime reductions since the onset of COVID, our research should provide us with a better understanding of whether this is also applicable to Los Angeles and to what extent. In the following weeks, we hope to connect our variables with the crime data and provide an analysis regarding the trends we may see.
